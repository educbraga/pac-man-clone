# Pacman Game

![Screenshot do projeto](./images/projeto.png)

This project is a simple recreation of the pacman game. Here I used HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.

For playing you just need to open the index.html file on your favorite web browser.

If you wish to make and play in a custom maze, you just need to edit the excel file, copy the numbers and paste them inside the index.js file
